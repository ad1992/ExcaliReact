# ExcaliReact

> **Experimental: Transform your Excalidraw sketches into React components!**
> ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Prototype%20%7C%20In%20Progress-orange?style=for-the-badge)

> A fun, experimental project that bridges the gap between design and development. Sketch your ideas in Excalidraw and watch them transform into React components.

# Why

As a long term user and maintainer of Excalidraw, I always use Excalidraw for any mockups or diagrams and want to turn them into code.

I wanted to go deeper into how to transform design to code and hence started on this experimental project to achieve the same. Currently this project is heavily in progress.

- **UI Elements** - Built-in buttons, inputs, and links
- **Live preview** - Toggle between sketch and generated code

- **Export ready** - Copy generated JSX directly to your project
